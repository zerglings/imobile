h2. Features

* In-App Purchase Receipts verification - imobile can verify a StoreKit receipt
with Apple's servers. Apple's response is parsed into a Ruby-friendly hash. See
Imobile.validate_receipt in validate_receipt.rb

* Push Notifications - imobile supports both pushing notifications and receiving
feedback from Apple's servers. imobile can use the .p12 certificates exported by
Keychain directly, and it knows to talk to both sandbox and production servers.
imobile can send notifications in batch mode, ideal for daemons and Cron jobs.
See Imobile.push_notifications and Imobile.push_feedback in push_notification.rb

* ZergSupport's CryptoSupport - imobile can validate the application fingerprint
generated by ZergSupport's CryptoSupport. Useful to know who's pirating your
applications. See Imobile.crypto_app_fprint in crypto_app_fprint.rb

* Production-friendly - imobile has great automated test coverage and all
methods are reasonably well document. The code is placed under the MIT license.
